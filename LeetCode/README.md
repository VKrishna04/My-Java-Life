## Problem 1

- Date: 17-02-2024
- URL: [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3238/)
- Additional Information: Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
- code: [MaxConsecutiveOnes.java](MaxConsecutiveOnes.java)
 
### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]`
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]`
Output: 2

### Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

## Problem 2

- Date: 10-02-2024
- URL: [Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3237/)
- Additional Information: Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
- code: [FindNumbersWithEvenNumberOfDigits.java](FindNumbersWithEvenNumberOfDigits.java)

 
### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]`
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
Example 2:

### Input: `nums = [555,901,482,1771]`
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.

### Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
```

## Problem 3

- Date: 10-02-2024
- URL: [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3240/)
- Additional Information: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
- code: [SquaresOfASortedArray.java](SquaresOfASortedArray.java)

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```
