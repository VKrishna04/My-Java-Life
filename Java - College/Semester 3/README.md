#### Midterm - 31st of October 2023 Practice Questions
###### How does the concept of `generalisation` work for in class diagrams.
  Ans  : Generalization is the process of extracting shared characteristics from two or more classes, and combining them into a generalized superclass. Generalization is used to simplify complex class diagrams, it provides a higher-level view of the class structure than the detailed view obtained when classes are modeled individually.

###### Differentiate between `class level` and `instance level` attributes with examples.
  Ans : Class level attributes are the attributes that are common to all the objects of the class. Instance level attributes are the attributes that are specific to each object of the class.

###### Describe the process of `identifying classes` and creating `CRC cards`.
  Ans : Identifying classes is the process of identifying the classes in a problem domain. CRC cards are used to represent the classes in a problem domain. Each card contains the name of the class, its responsibilities and its collaborators.
  CRC full form - Class, Responsibilities, Collaborators.

###### How is `UML` used to represent the structure of software system in object oriented software development.
  Ans : UML is used to represent the structure of software system in object oriented software development by using class diagrams, object diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, state diagrams, activity diagrams and component diagrams.
  UML full form - Unified Modeling Language.

###### Explain the significance of encapsulation in object oriented programming.
  Ans - Encapsulation is the process of combining data and methods into a single unit called class. It is used to hide the data from outside world and to protect the data from being modified by other methods. It is also used to provide security to the data.

###### How do Object oriented languages defer from procedural languages.
  Ans - Object oriented languages are different from procedural languages in the following ways:
  1. Object oriented languages are based on objects whereas procedural languages are based on functions.
  2. Object oriented languages are based on classes whereas procedural languages are based on procedures.
  3. Object oriented languages are based on data whereas procedural languages are based on logic.
  4. Object oriented languages are based on bottom-up approach whereas procedural languages are based on top-down approach.

###### Compare and contrast method overloading and method overriding in java and provide examples for each(sample code).
  Ans - Method overloading is the process of defining multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. Method overriding is the process of defining a method in the subclass that already exists in the superclass with the same name and same parameters. Method overloading is used to provide different implementations of the same method whereas method overriding is used to provide different implementations of the same method in the subclass.

###### How does the inheritance is related to the concept of super class and subclass in java and give examples.
  Ans - Inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties of one class by another class. The class that inherits the properties of another class is called subclass and the class whose properties are inherited by another class is called superclass. The subclass is also called child class and the superclass is also called parent class. The subclass inherits the properties of the superclass by using the keyword extends. The subclass can access the properties of the superclass by using the keyword super. The subclass can override the methods of the superclass by using the keyword override.

###### What is the purpose of the keyword `super` in java and give examples.
  Ans - The purpose of the keyword super in java is to access the properties of the superclass from the subclass. The keyword super is used to call the constructor of the superclass from the constructor of the subclass. The keyword super is used to call the methods of the superclass from the methods of the subclass. The keyword super is used to call the variables of the superclass from the variables of the subclass.

###### Describe the role of polymorphism in object oriented programming and give examples.
  Ans - Polymorphism is the process of defining multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. It is used to provide different implementations of the same method. It is used to provide different implementations of the same method in the subclass. It is used to provide different implementations of the same method in the superclass. It is used to provide different implementations of the same method in the subclass and superclass.

###### Explain the concept of composition in class diagram and give examples.
  Ans - Composition is the process of combining two or more classes into a single class. It is used to represent the relationship between two or more classes. It is used to represent the relationship between two or more classes in the class diagram. It is used to represent the relationship between two or more classes in the class diagram by using the keyword extends. It is used to represent the relationship between two or more classes in the class diagram by using the keyword implements. It is used to represent the relationship between two or more classes in the class diagram by using the keyword extends and implements.
